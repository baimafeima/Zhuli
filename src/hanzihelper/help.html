<h2>Hanzi Helper version 1.0</h2>

<a href="http://hanzihelper.sourceforge.net">http://hanzihelper.sourceforge.net</a><br>
<i>coljac@users.sourceforge.net</i>
 <p>
HanziHelper uses some functionality from the Dragon Character Training application
for PalmOS. Please check out this project at http://dragon-char.sf.net. Thanks a
lot to the developers of this project.
<p>
<h3>Intro</h3>
Hanzi Helper maintains a list of characters and lets you make practice sheets based
on these characters or a subset of them. It's a way of remember what you should know
and testing yourself, as well as practicing new characters you just learned. It lets
you export the characters in a variety of formats, and includes a utility to convert
chinese text files from one format to the other.
<p>
If you use this application, please consider letting the developer know what you
thought of it. This way, you can be sure it'll be actively maintained.
<p>
<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
Hanzi Helper requires Java to run. Java is available for most operating systems including
Windows, MacOS and Linux. You can get Java for free at <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a>. A good way to
test whether you already have java installed is to try and run the command "java -version".
You need to have Java 1.4 or greater to run this application. (The Reminder app requires Java 5.)
<p>
If you downloaded hanziHelper.jar, and you have Java installed, you ought to be able
to double-click on that file to run it. The first time it runs, it'll create a file called
hanzihelper.properties that stores your settings. If this doesn't work, you'll need
to tell your computer to run the command "javaw -jar hanziHelper.jar" from the command line or via a "shortcut".
 <p>
<h3>Using the Application</h3>

This program does not include any Chinese text functionality of its own. To view Chinese
characters, you will need to have a Chinese font installed, and to enter them into
the application, you'll need a Chinese input method installed on your operating
system (or cut-and-paste from somewhere else). The default font is "Arial Unicode MS"
which is the universal font that is installed with Microsoft Office. You'll probably
want to alter this. The screenshots were made using a font called "KaiTi_GB2312" in
a file called "simkai.ttf" - this excellent font ships with Chinese WinXP but you can
probably Google for it, or use the font of your choice. There is a font setup window
available from the main "File" menu. Note that the font sizes set here are only used
in the print section of the application (for now the fonts in the main display are of a
fixed size).
<p>
From the main window, you can view the current list of characters. To add new characters,
use <b>File-&gt;Add</b> from the menu or hit <b>alt-A</b>.
You must enter Pinyin and Chinese, but the
English is optional, as is the book information. Hitting enter from the English field
or pressing the OK button will add your character to the list. By hitting enter,
the form is reset so you can rapidly enter several characters in sequence. Pinyin entered
with text tone numbers (e.g. zhong1wen2) are translated into unicode tone marks for
display and printing. Similarly, Vs become ü/u: when rendered.
<p>
Entering multi-character words is ok. They will be split up on separate rows in the
character view, but randomizing the list for printing will not separate the characters
in a word.
<p>
When run for the first time, you'll want to create a "record" file. This is your list
of characters. You can have multiple record files if you wish. To create a record file,
use the "new" option from the file menu (<b>file-&gt;new</b>).
The only files needed by the application are you character list, which is a UTF-8
encoded text file, and hanzihelper.properties, which records your settings
such as paper size and fonts. You can edit these files externally if you want to.
<p>
The list can be filtered by book and chapter. Select "<b>show filter</b>" from the filter
menu. The books available are presented as a drop-down list. Chapter information can
be entered as a number, such as "3", or a range, such as "3-6". Once applied, the filter
will function in the list view and for printing as well. Also, the characters can be
highlighted from the main view. If any characters are highlighted, only highlighted
characters will be sent to the printing part of the application. This allows you to
pick a few characters or a range of characters to pring from your list. The same holds
true when exporting the list.
<p>
<h4>Viewing a character's stroke order</h4>
Try right-clicking on a character. If the character is known to the application, a window will
pop up showing the strokes in their correct order. Left clicking in this window will stop the character
from drawing itself, and advance by one stroke. Right clicking will clear the window to start over again.

<h4>Printing</h4>
When you are ready to print practice sheets, select <b>File-&gt;Print</b> or hit
ctrl-P in the main window. From here, select the style and text to print and you will be
shown a preview. You can change the page settings, fonts and box sizes here. If you
hit the "resize" button on the font dialog, it will iteratively figure out the biggest
font size that will fit in the boxes.
<p>
The options have the following meanings:
<p>
<b>Style 'one per row'</b>: A character will be printed in the left-most box only.<br>
<b>Style 'cram'</b>: A character will be printed in every second box, leaving room
  to copy it on the right.<br>
<b>Style 'rows'</b>: A character will be printed in every box, but only on every second
row.<br>
<b>Style 'read'</b>: No gaps are left for copying.<p>

The text options allow you choose whether the character itself or its pinyin or
english translation is printed. Good for testing yourself.
<p>
The other options change the character of the boxes themselves or the fonts used
for rendering text. Their use should be pretty straightforward.

<h4>Exporting</h4>
The application lets you export into a variety of formats. In most cases, you can export the whole
character record or the highlighted subset. Some of these might cause unpredictable
results, as many have not been used by any users apart from the developer. The supported formats are:
<p>
<b>Supermemo:</b> This is in a text format suitable for conversion to a Supermemo for Palm OS database.
<br>
<b>Q &amp; A:</b> This is a text format with questions and answers on separate lines (e.g. Q: 我, A: I).
This format is good for importing into a variety of flash-card programs, such as Supermemo for Windows.
<br>
<b>Excel XML:</b> This creates an XML file that can be opened by Microsoft Excel. It contains a bunch
of information about the character. I personally make a big binder of these, and use them to "get to know" a
character when it's new to me.
<br>
<b>Stroke images:</b> Creates .png image files that show how to write the characters. Select a diretory.
<br>
<!--<b>Description images:</b> Creates .png image files that show some data on the character-->
<!--stolen from zhongwen.com.-->
<!--<br>-->
<b>Dragon char:</b> Creates a .pdb binary file for use by Dragon Character Training on the Palm.
<br>
<b>Plecodict flashcards:</b> For importing into the PlecoDict software for PalmOS.
<br>
<b>Simple text list:</b> Your characters as one big long string. Useful for searching.
<br>
<b>VTrain</b>: Creates a text file using the default = | delimiters that can be imported into VTrain on Windows.
<p>

<h4>Converting files</h4>
As a bonus, the application includes the functionality to convert Chinese text files to and from a variety of
formats. <b>File-&gt;Convert</b> opens up a window that prompts you for an input and output file to convert.
You need to know what format the input file is in for it to work properly (there's really no such thing as a
"plain text" file these days, only text files with an associated encoding). If unsure, experiment and see. The
supported formats are:
<ul>
  <li><b>UTF-8</b>: A common Unicode format used around the web, that is compatible with ordinary plain text files.</li>
  <li><b>UTF-16</b>: A Unicode text format.</li>
  <li><b>GB2312</b>: The standard non-unicode way of representing simplified Chinese text.</li>
  <li><b>Big5</b>: The standard non-unicode way of representing traditional Chinese text.</li>
</ul>
The converter will also let you convert simplified to traditional and back again. Make sure that when performing
such a conversion the destination file is an appropriate format (simplified text won't be readable in a Big5 file,
and tradition in GB2312). The "Write BOM" check box is used when UTF-8 text is written. If selected, the
converter adds a so-called "byte order mark" to the start of the text file. Some applications require this mark to
be able to interpret UTF-8 text properly.

<h3>"Reminders"</h3>

As of version 0.8, the application also comes with a separate little app for "reminding"
you of the characters in your list as you work. It does this by putting a small window
in the corner of your screen, and cycling through the characters in the list at the speed
of your choice. (See the web site for a screenshot.) I decided it's too annoying to use, but
please be my guest. :)
<p>
Reminder is packaged as a separate executable jar file. It needs to be in the same
directory as hanziHelper.jar when run. Because of some features like always-on-top
windows, Reminder needs Java 5 to run.
<p>
The little window will initialize in the corner of your screen, but can be dragged around.
When Reminder has the focus, the following keyboard commands are enabled:
<p>
<b>Esc:</b> Quit<br>
<b>F1:</b> Change the time interval between characters<br>
<b>F2:</b> Toggle "always on top"<br>
<b>R:</b> Toggle random order         <br>
<b>Space:</b> Start/stop the rotation<br>
<b>Right/left:</b> Next/previous char<br>
<b>Home:</b> First char<br>

<p>
Reminder uses the last record file open in the main application. Optionally, you can
specify a filename as a command line parameter (e.g. "java -jar reminder.jar myRecord.rec").
<p>
Thanks for using Hanzi Helper!

<h3>Building from the sources</h3>
If you want to compile and try the latest version from the sources or the CVS, here
is what to do.
 <p>
HanziHelper is a Java application. To build from the sources, you need Java and
Ant (http://ant.apache.org) installed. Then just run "ant" in the HH directory.
The result will be build/hanziHelper.jar, which is an executable jar file. Run
with "java -jar hanziHelper.jar" or double-click on its icon.
